chore: improve code quality and development tooling

Enhance development experience and code quality with improved tooling:

- Add lint and type-check scripts to e2e package for better development workflow
- Format all files with Biome for consistent code style
- Add serve dependency for static file serving during build tests
- Update pnpm-lock.yaml with new dependencies for testing infrastructure

These improvements provide better developer experience with consistent formatting, type checking, and linting capabilities across the project.
