# storybook-addon-source-link

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#21](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/pull/21) [`e21c632`](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/commit/e21c632a0e26748653d651bbfdb80233849a3bbc) Thanks [@elecdeer](https://github.com/elecdeer)! - feat: migrate to Storybook v9

  This change updates the addon to support Storybook v9, which introduces several breaking changes:

  - Updated peer dependency to require Storybook ^9.0.0
  - Migrated demo package structure and configuration
  - Updated all internal imports to use new Storybook v9 APIs
  - Reorganized demo stories to follow new structure
  - Updated dependencies and build configuration for compatibility

  BREAKING CHANGE: This addon now requires Storybook v9 or later. Projects using older versions of Storybook will need to upgrade.

### Minor Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/pull/43) [`57bf147`](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/commit/57bf1476c77748b84f58fd7405976fbd4839fbf4) Thanks [@elecdeer](https://github.com/elecdeer)! - feat: add comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright

  This change adds comprehensive end-to-end testing capabilities to verify the addon functionality in both development and build environments:

  - Add Playwright testing framework with full E2E test suite
  - Create separate test configurations for dev and build environments
  - Add automated link validation for source code links in all story contexts
  - Test custom link parameters and function-based link generation
  - Add comprehensive coverage for Button, Header, Page, and Configure stories
  - Verify 'Powered by addon-source-link' display functionality
  - Add test scripts for dev, build, and UI test modes
  - All tests pass in both development (5/5) and production build (5/5) environments

  The E2E tests ensure the addon works correctly across different Storybook environments and validates that source links are properly generated and functional.

### Patch Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/pull/47) [`7345627`](https://github.com/elecdeer/storybook-addon-source-link/commit/73456277284a911cb02f18c80db31154552d6f8e) Thanks [@elecdeer](https://github.com/elecdeer)! - Improve static build detection using Storybook CONFIG_TYPE

  Replace NODE_ENV-based detection with more accurate Storybook-specific environment variables. This provides more reliable build environment detection and adds proper warning when CONFIG_TYPE is unavailable for better debugging.

  Enhance development experience and code quality with improved tooling:

  - Add lint and type-check scripts to e2e package for better development workflow
  - Format all files with Biome for consistent code style
  - Add serve dependency for static file serving during build tests
  - Update pnpm-lock.yaml with new dependencies for testing infrastructure

  These improvements provide better developer experience with consistent formatting, type checking, and linting capabilities across the project.

  Restructure the demo package to better reflect its primary purpose as an E2E testing environment:

  - Rename packages/demo directory to packages/e2e
  - Update package name from "demo" to "e2e" in package.json
  - Update root package.json scripts to reference e2e package
  - Update README.md documentation to use e2e path examples
  - Clean up old demo package directory after successful migration

  This change provides better semantic clarity as the package is primarily used for end-to-end testing of the addon functionality rather than just demonstration purposes.
